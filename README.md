# Django example full-stack Web App with focus on Backend

Example Web application to test Django, Django REST Framework, relational databases and JavaScript for Frontend with Bootstrap styling

The project parodies job search Web Apps with custom **registration, database structure, API endpoints for Frontend, functionality to save files in bytes direclty in db and Frontend on vanilla Javascipt and stylization using Bootstrap library.**

During the project I were learning core Backend skills. At the end, I think, I did a good job and now able to effectively participate in bigger projects and companies.

## If you are an HR

I want you to know that I am currently developing a new interesting personal project with real-life usage.

The new project will be written on Express JS using TypeScript and MongDB database with Redis implementation. All of these are new technologies for me, but they will be definetelly handy in my work as a Web developer.

I can give you acces to the private repository, so you can look at my progress.
